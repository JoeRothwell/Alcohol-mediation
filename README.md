# Molecular mediators of alcohol intake for CRC

This repository contains the code for the metabolite mediators for alcohol intake and CRC project. Different metabolite mediators are prepared in the script Make_alc_mediators.R. Mediation analyses are then performed in Alc_mediation_analysis.R. 

---

Alc_mediation_function.R is the development of a function that runs models and automatically returns NDE, NIE and percentage mediated metrics. This is currently in development.
